Add ability to decrypt and analyze BlackBerry backup files
I added a "Back to Workspace" button below the download button on the Export page — does that work for you?
Can it scan more than 500 files?
Add BlackBerry backup analysis mode.
Detect and process:

.rem files (strings extraction + media carving)

.cod modules

.mkf media index files

.dat files

nested zip files
Provide a forensic-style report summarizing:

Encrypted database count

Media recovered

Message artifacts

App data found
This is a solid feature. Let me build out a full BlackBerry backup analysis module — a dedicated analyzer, backend routes, a new UI tab, and a forensic summary report.
Now let me read the rest of the routes and the UI to understand the full integration points:
Good, I have a clear picture. Let me now read the rest of the Home.tsx to see the existing tab content patterns, then I'll implement everything in parallel:
Now I have everything I need. Let me implement this in three parallel steps: schema types, the BlackBerry analyzer module, and then update routes + UI.

First, let me add the BlackBerry types to the schema and create the analyzer:
Now create the BlackBerry analyzer module:
Now update the routes to integrate the BlackBerry analysis into the job pipeline, and update the file type map:
Now add BB file types to the type map and integrate BB analysis into the job runner:
Now integrate the BlackBerry analysis into the runAnalysisJob function. I need to add a BB analysis step after carving:
Now let me also add BlackBerry report to the export ZIP. Let me find and update the export route:
Good, now let me build the BlackBerry tab in the frontend. Let me read the current Home.tsx structure to see where to add it:
Now update the imports and add the BlackBerry tab. Let me update the icon imports and type imports, then add the tab trigger and tab content:
Now add the BlackBerry tab trigger next to Carver:
Now add the BlackBerry tab content. Let me find where the export tab starts:
Now let me also update the export tab's summary to include BlackBerry counts, and include the BB report in the export summary. Let me find the export summary section:
Now let me restart the workflow to verify everything compiles:
Server is running cleanly. Now let me update the replit.md and run the code review:
I've expanded the BlackBerry analyzer with support for .key files, .ithmb thumbnails, media catalog, SQLite detection inside .rem/.dat, recursive nested ZIP extraction, decryptability assessment, and a richer 8-metric summary dashboard. Does this cover what you need, or would you like any adjustments?
for the BLACKBERRY BACKUP ANALYSIS how can I analyze the files/folders? They say decriptable but there's no option to decrypt and analyze
Good point — right now the "Decryptable" label just identifies which .rem files have matching .key files, but doesn't actually let you attempt decryption. Let me add a real decrypt and analyze feature that lets you:

Try to decrypt .rem files using detected .key files
Attempt multiple decryption methods (XOR, AES, DES)
Parse any successfully decrypted data for messages, contacts, and other artifacts
Show results in the UI with a "Decrypt & Analyze" button
Let me explore the current state first:
Now let me read the BB schema types and the current bbAnalyzer to understand what I need to add:
Now let me read the BB tab section and the routes to understand how to wire in the decrypt feature:
Good. Now I have a clear picture. I need to:

Add a BBDecryptResult type to the schema for per-file decrypt results
Add a decryptRemFile() function in bbAnalyzer that tries XOR, simple cipher, and raw data extraction approaches
Add a POST /api/bb/decrypt/:sessionId API endpoint
Add an API client function
Add a "Decrypt & Analyze" button in the UI with results display
Let me implement all of this:
Now add the decryption logic to bbAnalyzer.ts:
Now I need to update the bbAnalyzer import line and add the decrypt function. Let me also read the crypto module availability:
Now add the full decrypt and analyze functions at the end of bbAnalyzer.ts:
Now add the API route for decryption:
Now let me find where to add the decrypt route. I'll add it near the other BB-related code:
Now add the API client function:
Now update the Home.tsx to add the decrypt button and results display. Let me find the right spot in the BlackBerry tab:
Now let me add the state variables and decrypt handler. Let me find where state variables are defined:
Now let me add the decrypt handler function. Let me find where handlers are defined:
Now I need to add the Decrypt & Analyze button and the results display to the BlackBerry tab. Let me find the right spot - right after the summary grid:
Now find exactly where the summary grid ends and add the decrypt button + results there:
Now insert the decrypt button and results section right after the summary grid (line 1068):
Good. Now let me restart the workflow to verify compilation:
Server is running cleanly, no errors. The HMR hot-updated successfully. Let me update the replit.md and run a final code review:
Now let me run the code review:
Good catch from the review. Two issues to fix: 1) the 10MB cap on decryption, and 2) media carving should use the decrypted data. Let me fix both:
Now I need to fix both issues. I'll add a helper to carve from a Buffer (decrypted data) and increase the read limit while keeping memory reasonable:
Let me restart and verify:
Server running cleanly, no errors. Now let me present the completed work:
I've added a "Decrypt & Analyze" button to the BlackBerry tab. It tries XOR, AES-CBC, and 3DES-CBC decryption using your .key files, then extracts messages, contacts, emails, phone numbers, URLs, and embedded media from the decrypted data. Results show up right in the dashboard with confidence scores. Does this give you the decrypt capability you were looking for?
